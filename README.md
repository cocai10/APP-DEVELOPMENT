# 3 SONGS

## 1. YELLOW

**The prompt is to show off something or someone you love. The color of sunshine, yellow brings about positive feelings. Joy, happiness, and hope are all within yellow's domain. It can boost confidence, curiosity, and even improve learning.

## 2. THE MAN WHO CAN'T BE MOVED

**The song was about true emotion and true love and not having, in a day where a lot of people would be able to buy somebody back or give them enough flowers to win them back.To do something selfless and to do something that you don't really know and to kind of put it out there with fate. That's what we wanted from the song.

## 3. HERE WITHOUT YOU

** Its about that person who (well I'd like to think of it this way) you broke up with either recently or a long time ago. And you later find out or realize that, that person means the whole world to you. Only this time its too dang late. Shes gone and shes so far away and all you can ever do is dream about her, and live for that moment that you will be together in your dreams. Its a sad song, a song of regrets maybe, but generally i think its a sad song.
